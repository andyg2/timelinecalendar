Javascript calendar with zoom and move events

Checkout the files and copy them to a directory in your webspace.
Take a look at fetch_data.php. This script is returns the appointments/dates.

For implementing a datastore you have to create a file in json-format.
Each item has to contain the following values.

The start/end values are given as cgi-parameters named start and offset.

{
	id : int,
	start : timestamp,
	end : timestamp,
	data : text
}

There is also an example store in stores folder for perl and a simple 
php skript.
